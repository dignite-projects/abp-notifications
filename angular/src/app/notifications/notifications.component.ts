/**
 * Demo page consuming the @dignite/abp.ng.notification-center library components against the host API.
 * The toolbar bell is registered globally by provideNotificationCenterConfig() and refreshes from SignalR.
 * The "Send order shipped notification" button publishes explicitly to the current user (bypasses
 * subscriptions, always arrives) with the host's Demo.OrderShipped payload so the bell uses a custom
 * NotificationData renderer; "Publish to subscribers" demonstrates the actual point of subscriptions — it
 * omits userIds, so DefaultNotificationDistributor resolves recipients from NotificationSubscription rows
 * instead, and only arrives if you're currently subscribed to "Announcement" on the Settings page's
 * Subscriptions tab.

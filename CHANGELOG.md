# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html) — with one
deviation from the classic scheme: see [CONTRIBUTING.md → Versioning and releases](CONTRIBUTING.md#versioning-and-releases)
for why `MAJOR` tracks the targeted ABP Framework version rather than this module's own breaking
changes.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed

- Notification definition names and `NotificationData` discriminators now use explicit ordinal,
  case-sensitive registration and lookup. Conflicting registrations fail during application startup
  with both providers or CLR mappings identified instead of silently replacing an earlier value. Definition
  providers are discovered across module assemblies and duplicate registrations of the same provider execute once.
- Defined consistent explicit-recipient semantics across inline and background distribution: `null`
  resolves subscriptions, an empty list is a no-op, and duplicate explicit user IDs are normalized
  before threshold selection, persistence, and channel delivery.

## [10.0.0-rc.2] - 2026-07-16

### Changed

- Renamed the Angular package to `@dignite/abp.ng.notification-center`, making the UI framework
  explicit and leaving room for parallel React or other client packages.
- Clarified that npm requires every package to have a `latest` dist-tag, so a package whose first
  public version is a pre-release temporarily exposes that version as both `next` and `latest`.

## [10.0.0-rc.1] - 2026-07-16

### Added

- Added CI coverage for the Angular library and production demo build.
- Added isolated consumption smoke tests for all 15 packed NuGet packages and both Angular package
  entry points.

### Changed

- Synchronized the Angular package version with the NuGet release version.
- Renamed the Angular package to `@dignite/abp-notification-center` so all Dignite npm packages
  share the `@dignite` organization scope.
- Tagged pre-releases are now published publicly to NuGet.org and npm in addition to the existing
  GitHub Packages preview feed.
- Replaced the long-lived NuGet API key with NuGet.org Trusted Publishing and a short-lived OIDC
  credential issued to the tagged release workflow.
- Expanded the README with package installation commands, a compatibility table, and migration
  guidance for legacy 3.x consumers.

## [10.0.0-preview.2] - 2026-07-10

> `MAJOR` tracks the targeted ABP Framework version, so a breaking change to this module's own
> contracts arrives in a `MINOR` bump. Entries below marked **Breaking** require action when
> upgrading.

### Added

- Added `Dignite.Abp.Notifications.Emailing.Identity`, an optional ABP Identity-backed
  `IEmailNotificationAddressResolver` for the Emailing notifier.
- `NotificationDeliveryEto` and `NotificationDelivery` now carry the notification's `EntityTypeName` and
  `EntityId`, so a notifier can identify the business entity a notification is about without depending on
  Core.
- Added `NotificationEmailContentProvider<TData>`, a base class that narrows `NotificationData` once so an
  implementer cannot forget the type guard and accidentally claim every notification.
- Email address resolvers can now return an optional recipient culture; email content is built inside that culture
  and falls back to `NotificationEmailOptions.DefaultCulture`.

### Changed

- Changed email address resolution to use `EmailNotificationAddressResolveContext`, making
  `TenantId` explicit to local and remote resolver implementations.
- **Breaking.** `NotificationEntityIdentifier` now takes `(string entityTypeName, string entityId)` instead of
  `(Type entityType, object entityId)` — pass a short, stable name such as `"Demo.Order"`. Persisted
  `EntityTypeName` values are therefore no longer `Type.FullName`, so subscription rows and
  `NotificationCenterWebOptions.EntityLinkResolvers` keys written in the old format stop matching.
- **Breaking.** `IEmailNotificationAddressResolver` gained an `Order` member, and `GetEmailOrNullAsync` returns
  `Task<EmailNotificationAddress?>` rather than `Task<string?>`. Resolvers now form an ordered chain in which the
  first non-null address wins.
- **Breaking.** `IdentityEmailNotificationAddressResolver` no longer declares `[Dependency(ReplaceServices = true)]`.
  It joins the chain at `NotificationEmailProviderOrders.BuiltInFallback`, so an application resolver composes with
  it rather than displacing it.
- **Breaking.** Renamed `NotificationEmailContentProviderOrders` to `NotificationEmailProviderOrders`, which now
  orders both the content-provider and the address-resolver chains.
- **Breaking.** `NotificationEmailBuildContext`'s constructor gained a `cultureName` parameter.
- Documented that atomic persist-and-publish, and deduplication of a redelivered event, require the host to enable
  ABP's transactional outbox — `UseNotificationCenterEfCoreOutbox()` on EF Core. The MongoDB provider wires neither.
  No behaviour changed; the previous comments and README described a guarantee that was conditional.

### Fixed

- `EmailNotifier` no longer aborts the whole delivery when a recipient's culture name cannot be parsed. It falls
  back to `NotificationEmailOptions.DefaultCulture` and then to the ambient culture, logging a warning for each
  rejected value. Previously a single malformed per-user language setting threw out of the event handler, so every
  recipient after it received nothing and a redelivery re-mailed the ones before it. As part of this,
  `NotificationEmailBuildContext.CultureName` now accepts the empty string, which is the invariant culture.

### Removed

- **Breaking.** Removed `NullEmailNotificationAddressResolver` — an empty resolver chain already resolves no
  address.

## [10.0.0-preview.1] - 2026-07-09

### Added

- Initial public release: an event-driven, pluggable notification framework for ABP Framework
  (`core/`), plus an optional Notification Center providing a persistent inbox, subscriptions,
  read/unread state, and a REST API, with MVC and Angular UI libraries
  (`notification-center/`).
- Dual persistence support (EF Core and MongoDB) behind a shared `INotificationStore` abstraction.
- Real-time push (SignalR) and email notifiers.
- Optional permission gating for notification definitions via ABP Identity.
